# Enterprise-Learning
A J2EE project which can used for Learning-online

It's a project base on struts2,which is an old enough frame.
This project should run on Apache Tomcat,
It's a online-learning system,which is used for some company to train or improve their employees' professional skills.
It mainly devide into two parts,the User mode and the Admin mode.
The User mode can view the courses that he should/could learn,get some points from his learning behavior.
The System also recommend some courses to specific Users which could be useful for the User,the recommended algorithym is 
 content-based recommendation.
